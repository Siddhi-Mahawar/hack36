We , the students of first year of MNNIT, are building a website to provide study material including notes,assignments,previous examination papers and books which will meet the demands and solve the problems of the students and icing on the cake is that one can post their query and others can answer it 
In addition to this website we are planning to introduce a comprehensive way of selling of textbooks,drafter,bicycle by direct contact between students.
